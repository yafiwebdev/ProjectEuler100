# ProjectEuler100
Inspired by FreeCodeCamp's "ProjectEuler100" Challenge

I love working on algorithms every now and then, and this challenge is a very nice way of doing that. 
So, I am really excited to join the others and embark on this journey with a goal, powered by great motivation to be a bit better every day.
