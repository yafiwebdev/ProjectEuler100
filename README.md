# ProjectEuler100
Introduced by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), "ProjectEuler100" is a challenge for solving at least the first 100 algorithm problems on [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)

I love working on algorithms every now and then, and this challenge is a very nice way of doing that, as it has a specific motivating goal.
So, I am really excited to join the others and embark on this journey, powered by great motivation to be a bit better every day.

## Contributing to this repository
I started this repo for my personal use to document my own solutions, but feel free to contribute and add your solutions in **other** programming languages.

### Why contribute?
It would be a great way to provide solutions in as many programming languages as possible in one single repository as a reference to help others learn more.

## Contribution Rules
- Follow the **file naming convention** used in existing languages' directories
- ***Comment the code*** where necessary to explain to others(or your future forgetful self) why you used certain approaches or methods and what they're exactly doing.
